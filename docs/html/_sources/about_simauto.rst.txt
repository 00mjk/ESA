    The Simulator Automation Server (SimAuto) allows you to take
    advantage of the power of automation to extend the functionality of
    PowerWorld Simulator to any external program that you write. Using
    Simulator Automation Server you can launch and control PowerWorld
    Simulator from within another application, enabling you to: access
    the data of a Simulator case, perform defined Simulator functions
    and other data manipulations, and send results back to your original
    application, to a Simulator auxiliary file, or to a MicrosoftÂ® Excel
    spreadsheet.
