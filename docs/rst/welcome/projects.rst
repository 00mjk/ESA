ESA has already been utilized in several research projects past and
present. If you use ESA in your work, please file an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/mzy2240/ESA/issues>`__ and we'll list your
project here!

-   In `gym-powerworld <https://github.com/blthayer/gym-powerworld>`__,
    ESA was used to create a standardized reinforcement learning
    environment for power system voltage control. This environment was
    then `used to carry out deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
    experiments <https://github.com/blthayer/drl-powerworld>`__
    in which the algorithm attempts to learn how to best control grid
    voltages under a diverse set of grid conditions.
-   In `this paper
    <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9042493>`__,
    ESA was leveraged to create and simulate different electric grid
    scenarios where load, renewable generation levels, generation
    capacities, scheduled outages, and unit commitment were all varied.
    The resulting scenarios were used in the
    `Grid Optimization (GO) competition
    <https://gocompetition.energy.gov/>`__
    hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
-   ESA is used by an ongoing research project entitled "Real Time
    Monitoring Applications for the Power Grid under Geomagnetic
    Disturbances (GMD)": Recently, a real-world GMD monitoring system
    consisting of six magnetometers was deployed in Texas. The resulting
    magnetic field measurements are coupled with ground conductivity models
    to calculate real-time electric fields. These can then be fed to a grid
    model of Texas using ESA to enable calculation of real-time
    geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) for monitoring and
    visualization.
