  abstract={As the smart grid initiative is pushing for smarter controls, the need for artificial intelligence-based decision-making tools, such as agent-based programs, is becoming more prevalent. However, these tools alone are not sufficient to study the behavior of the algorithms in simulations. They need to be interfaced with power systems analysis tools such as PowerWorld Simulator. This paper proposes a framework for co-simulation with two types of tools: a) MathWorks Matlab and PowerWorld, and b) the multiagent middleware JADE and PowerWorld. The source code for this framework has been made available in the public domain for the research community.},

  abstract={The development of synthetic transmission networks has equipped the power system research community with public test cases that can be used and shared freely. As the synthetic electric grid power flow model only represents a one-time snapshot of the system, this paper proposes a methodology of developing scenarios that can reflect a wide spectrum of system operating conditions. The general process of determining load and generation levels, planning scheduled outages, and dispatching generators is discussed. Techniques that are commonly used to aid the convergence of power flow of scenario case are also provided.},
